# NOTE: You need to pass in the full paths to the file references below. The data is file should be private and it's
# not in the project. The reason is you should create a YAML file that fits how you want to configure your
# environment. For eample, you can have a small YAML data file for configuring the kickstart/ISO process and then
# maybe one for building out the missing USER and/or SYSTEM data used in the CHEF Environment files. A sample
# environment file ships with the project for vagrant called vagrant.json. However, a production.json should
# really be a jinja2 template like base_environment.json.j2 with as much default data and with template {{ }} placeholders
# for the actual data. The output of this process should be the TRUE production.json file. Also, it's a good idea
# to name your production.json file more descriptive of the environment it actually belongs to. For example,
# prod-dc101.json or something like it.
