# Important

## Start:
Simply call **./CEPH_UP** in *this* directory to start the build process.

NOTE: If you're behind a proxy then call ./CEPH_UP with a -p option like so:
./CEPH_UP -p http://proxy.whatever_my_domain.com:81

Make sure to include the trailing port number if different than the default of 80.

DEBUG: If you want to debug ceph-chef then add `-d` to the ./CEPH_UP CLI as well. This will bypass the download process for ceph-chef and use the existing ceph-chef cookbook in the `cookbooks` section if it exists (make sure it's there).

## Possible issues and work arounds
## Network:
This is VirtualBox related. Scenario: If you build the VMs while connected to one network and then later try to do things that use the network (yum installs etc) then you may see that there appears to be no connection. This usually relates to the bridge device on the VMs. The easiest way around it is to run the following from your laptop/host:

 (Must be ran in *this* vagrant directory)

 **./vagrant_reset_network.sh**

This script is what dynamically builds the network devices for the VMs so simply running it again will remove the current devices, IPs, etc and add then recreate them.

**NOTE:** It has also been seen that working via a VPN can sometimes cause the same issue at random times. Again, just run the above reset script to reset the connections.

## Vagrant plugins:
 **vagrant-vbguest** - This plugin is suppose to automatically upgrade your virtualbox guest additions but if the version of VirtualBox Guest Additions you have installed is more current than the version the OS 'box' version then the plugin can cause vagrant to fail.

 To check to see if the plugin is installed then do the following:

 **vagrant plugin list**

 If the 'vagrant-vbguest' shows then remove it as follows:

  **vagrant plugin uninstall vagrant-vbguest**

 Now rerun **./CEPH_UP** in the following directory:

 **[chef-bcs root-dir]/bootstrap/vms/vagrant**

## Proxy:
 If you run behind a corporate proxy then you may need to make a few simple modifications to get Vagrant to work correctly. Vagrant uses it's own embedded version of 'curl' found in /opt/vagrant/embedded. There is a CA bundle there called cacert.pem. There are two ways to get it to work correctly.
 1. Get copies of your corporate .crt or .pem files and simply concat them to cacert.pem in the above directory.
 2. Create a new .pem file with *all* of the certs your firm requires combined into the one file (bundle). Then add an environment variable called CURL_CA_BUNDLE=<the name and location of the new file>
 Note: Some firms use more than one cert so make sure you have whatever is required.
 This is important so that the correct 'box' OS version gets downloaded and cached to your system.

 Proxy and cert values need to be added to the <chef-bcs root>/bootstrap/vms/environment_config.yaml so that they get added to the VMs so that the remote repos can be accessed.
 The following items in the environment_config.yaml need to be updated:
 http_proxy:
 https_proxy:
 ssl_ca_file_path:
 ssl_intermediate_file_path:
 *Note: The ssl_intermediate_file_path may not be required by your organization and thus can be left empty.
