# This is for situations where you have a partial setup on something and you want to override the default
# 'set -e' option. Put here so it's easy to see but the condition is further down after basic tests are performed.
# This allows you to pass anything in after the script in question which means you're making a decision to override
# the default of erroring out on anything that comes up such as 'already installed' etc. If nothing is passed in
# then the default is assumed.
# Note: This setting is only valid until something downstream (another script) overrides it.
