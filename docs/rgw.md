## RADOS Gateway (RGW) APIs (Hammer)

Red Hat documentation link (link may require access):
https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en/red-hat-ceph-storage/1.3/paged/object-gateway-guide-for-red-hat-enterprise-linux/chapter-7-object-gateway-s3-api

Ceph documentation link:
http://docs.ceph.com/docs/master/radosgw/s3

http://docs.ceph.com/docs/hammer/dev/radosgw/s3_compliance/

Ceph's documenting is really lacking. So, we went through and tested each Python Boto3 API (see sample code link below).

Ceph Object Gateway supports a RESTful API that is compatible with the basic data access model of the Amazon S3 API. Certain features of AWS are not available for RGW (see below).

#### Thrid party APIs
Python Boto3 (official AWS):
http://boto3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/services/s3.html

sudo -E -H pip install boto3

>(note: if installing on Mac OSX you may run into an issue with the 'six' package. If this occurs then add '--ignore-installed six' after boto3 above)

###### Sample Python boto3 code:
https://github.com/bloomberg/chef-bcs/blob/master/cookbooks/chef-bcs/files/default/s3-example-boto3.py

This example code show all of the available features of RGW's implementation of AWS S3 interface. See the code comments for details.

#### Third party utilities:
S3CMD:
http://s3tools.org/s3cmd

This utility is a simple CLI to do all of the basic S3 commands available to RGW. It's not a performance driven tool and the current version does not use the official AWS Python Boto3 library. It implements it's own which is fine.

This utility also has an SDK for GO that can be used to write go-lang applications to access RGW.
