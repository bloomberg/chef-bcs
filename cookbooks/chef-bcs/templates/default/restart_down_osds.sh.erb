# IMPORTANT: This script needs to run from a Ceph node!

# IMPORTANT: It's best to do the following before running this so that you use your key with no prompts by the given host
# ssh-agent bash
# ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
# Answer any pass phrase if there is one and then you're good to go...

# NOTE: The first user is the one that should be the "operations" like user and be the one with the ssh key.
