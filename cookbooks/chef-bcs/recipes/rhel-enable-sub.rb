# PURPOSE:
# This recipe registers the rhel subscription with a Satellite/Capsule server.

if node['chef-bcs']['cobbler']['os']['breed'] == 'redhat' && !node['chef-bcs']['cobbler']['repo_mirror'] && node['chef-bcs']['cobbler']['redhat']['management']['type'] != "off"
  execute 'rhel-enable-repo' do
    command "subscription-manager register --activationkey #{node['chef-bcs']['cobbler']['redhat']['management']['key']} --org \"Default_Organization\" --force"
  end
end

# NOTE: IF you're in a closed (private network) environment and do not have access to RHN or a Satellite/Capsule
# server then you can use the Red Hat Customer Portal and register the nodes. After that you can export the PEM
# file needed to be imported with subscription-manager import -- certificate=<whatever pem file>
# There is no recipe for it but you can easily add it.
