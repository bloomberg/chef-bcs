# NOTE: If your crushmap has the wrong number of rules then most likely the crushmap is incorrect and the PGs will stay in a state of confusion.
# If your crushmap hierarchy design does *NOT* include your pools as rules but when you view your crushmap it shows a rule that matches your pools
# *AND* your PGs are confused (stale+inactive...) then your process of adding/moving the OSD and/or setting your crush_ruleset for your pool may
# be incorrect. Also note, you can have rules for pools if that fits your design. Experiment with the hierarchy before declaring something
# production ready.
