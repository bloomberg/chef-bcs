# IF the device is activated this should cause a scsi rescan. If the devices does not show then make sure it is
# enabled via HBA vendor specific commands maybe.

# You can look at other scsi device information with:
# cat /proc/scsi/scsi
# This show the Host/Channel/Id/Lun information (Lun is always 0 in this environment)

# NOTE: This works better than rescan-scsi-bus.sh which comes with the sg3_utils

# You can also just call this script like (this will scan everything for host 0):
# ./add_device_to_os.sh 0 - -
# OR
# ./add_device_to_os.sh (let the defaults do the work)

# No lun so default to -
