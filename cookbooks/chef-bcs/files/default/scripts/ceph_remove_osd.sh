# Step 1 (reweight down to 0.0)
# Reweighting down to 0.0 all at once is not a good thing unless there is only a small
# amount of data. Otherwise, you will get a lot of rebalancing that can degrade
# cluster's performance.
# *IF* the OSD has a number of objects then pick a smaller reweight of something less than
# 1.0. For example, ceph osd crush reweight osd.XXX .90. If that goes quickly then you
# can most likely increase the lowering reweight until you see it beginning to hit
# the cluster performance. In that case, back down on the delta each time. Continue
# with this process until you hit a final 0.0 reweight.

# Step 2 (on the node where the OSD resides)
# If a drive has failed, Ceph will have already marked the OSD out and the service may already be down so `set +e` for those two commands
set +e
ceph osd out $osd
# NOTE: Can change the next line to ssh into the host to shut it down or just run this on the node itself.
sudo service ceph stop osd.$osd
set -e
ceph osd crush remove osd.$osd
ceph auth del osd.$osd
ceph osd rm $osd

# Now remove mount
set +e
sudo umount /var/lib/ceph/osd/ceph-$osd
sudo rm -rf /var/lib/ceph/osd/ceph-$osd

# Modify this line if needed
sudo rm /var/run/ceph/ceph-osd.$osd.asok

# IMPORTANT: It's worth repeating - DO NOT just reweight to 0.0 in one call unless there
# is just a small of amount of data on the OSD!
