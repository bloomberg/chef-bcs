# IMPORTANT: This script needs to run from a Ceph node!

# NOTE: This script *assumes* that you have a user and user ssh key on each node!
# For example, the default user below is 'operations' so change that to whatever user you wish it to be.

# NOTE: I suggest that you set the nodown attribute in ceph *before* you run any ceph command that will impact
# OSDs. For example, before running this (assuming nodown is not already set), call: 'ceph osd set nodown'
# This will keep the HEALTH_WARNING flag set but keep the OSDs from being marked down while PGs get moved around.
# After everything settles down you can then call: 'ceph osd unset nodown' and the HEALTH_OK should appear.

for i in $(ceph osd tree | awk '/down/ {print $1}'); do
  host=$(ceph osd find $i | awk -F\" '$2 ~ /host/ {print $4}')
  ssh -t -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no operations@$host "sudo service ceph restart osd.$i"
done
