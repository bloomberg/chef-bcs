# Example of deleting an attribute for normal_attrs. You can also use default_attrs and override_attrs.
# You can also use :all in place of 'name:<node name here>' below...
# knife exec -E "nodes.find(:name => 'NODE-1') { |node|  node['node_data']['source_repo'] = '/new/path/softwares/'; node.save; }"

# This will remove ALL of the OSD attributes for a given node. After this is ran you can run: sudo chef-client
# on the node to rebuild the ALL of the OSDs.

# IMPORTANT: Make sure to follow this guideline for adding the OSDs for the given *IF* the node had OSDs BEFORE
# (If the node never had OSDs before then don't use this script)
# 1. Stop Ceph on node: sudo service ceph stop
# 2. If /var/lib/ceph/osd/ceph-* are mounted (df -h) then: sudo umount /var/lib/ceph/osd/*
# 3. Run ./ceph_cleanup_wipe_out_osds_on_node.sh on the node itself (will have to be rebooted - see #4)
# 4. Attempt to remove ceph-* directories: sudo rm -rf /var/lib/ceph/osd/ceph-* (most likely it will not remove the directories because it's busy - reboot will be required)
# 5. After reboot (see #4) then try to remove directories again
# 6. Run this command on the bootstrap node where the Chef Server is located
# 7. Run sudo chef-client on the given node (this will re-create the OSDs and Journals)
# 8. May need to start Ceph again on node so check. If so then: sudo service ceph start and run sudo chef-client again (this will update the crushmap now that the OSD daemons are running again)
